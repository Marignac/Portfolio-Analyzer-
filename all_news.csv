""To see a government that's really focused on growth and being able to make the economy everything that it can be, because ultimately, as one of America's leading banks, we are focused on helping our customers to be able to grow and thrive. You know, that's what our platforms are all about,"" Vince says. As deregulation under Trump is expected to benefit the financial sector, Vince says he's ""not that concerned"" about the risks associated with loose regulation. ""We have to be vigilant that that doesn't happen. We need a strong, healthy financial system,"" he says, explaining, "" We've seen how the strong banks have been able to actually help the system over the course of the events ... We've been a force for strength in the economy, and that's actually the role that we should be playing."" The CEO underlines, ""I'm looking forward. I'm thinking about the innovation. I'm thinking about the investment. I'm thinking about helping to make economies grow and our clients be successful.""

Narayan indicates that while Trump's proposed tariffs were ""expected,"" he finds it ""interesting"" that implementation was pushed to February. He emphasizes that if implemented, these tariffs would have severe consequences for the US auto industry. ""The now president ran on a campaign of bringing inflation down. A car purchase is one of the most highest-profile purchases the consumer can make.
